1. We will have to understand what the read function does
2. We will have to understand what static variables are.
3. The buffer size can be 1, unless the evaluator specifies.
4. We consider that get_next_line() has an undefined behavior if the file 
	pointed to by the file descriptor changed since the last call 
	whereas read() didnâ€™t reach the end of file. 
5. We also consider that get_next_line() has an undefined behavior when reading 
	a binary file. However, you can implement a logical way 
	to handle this behavior if you want to.
6. Buffer size, if not explicitly mentioned, can be defined by you.
