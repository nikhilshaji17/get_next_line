Static variables:
1. static local variables - variables whose value persist across function calls
2. Example:
	void f()
	{
		static int calls = 0;
		calls += 1;
		printf("Value of calls: %d\n", calls);
	}

	int main()
	{
		f();
		f();
	}
3. In the above example, the first call to f declares a static int named calls
	and initializes its value to 0. Then it is incremented and printed.
4. The second call however, does not redeclare calls.
5. Rather, the previous function call value is stored and used again.
6. Think of static variables as those that are declared only once.
7. the variable calls is a static local variable

Example where static variables are useful:
1. We can use them to track the log messages, in order to identify
	when things went wrong
2. test_two.c is an example program that shows this work

File opening and reading:
1. Generally, a system call is a way to get resources from the OS
2. In this example, we are requesting to open a file and then read it.
3. In linux, most of the system resources are represented as files like sockets
	and pipes
4. The read function has 3 parameters, the file descriptor, the array to 
	read into, and finally the number of bytes to read.
5. It returns the number of bytes successfully read. This can be 0 if we are
	at the end of the file, or it can be less than count in case we 
	do not have that many bytes remaining to read.
6. You want to make sure that the buffer is big enough to accept as many bytes
	at a time, in order to minimize the number of system calls you make.
7. The -D flag is used to define the value of a variable at compile time,
	and we use it to define BUFFER_SIZE (if required)

Plan:
1. Read everything into a temporary buffer
2. Iterate through the temporary buffer till the new line character, and append 
	everything to the new buffer
3. Use strjoin function to add all the new letters to your final string
